### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1: 
    else
      return False
      return True
      # should be return true above else then return false
      # should be card.value == 1:
      
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2): # should be def + should have commas between cards
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card # should be card1
  else:
    return card2
  # full function needs to indented one more.

# full function needs indented to fit within the class.
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total # variable should have a operator followed by a value
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value 
    return "You have a total of" + total # return indented incorrectly
                                        # total needs to turned into 
  
```
